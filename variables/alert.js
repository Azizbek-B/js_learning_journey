let message;

message = "Hello";

// Optionally we can declare variable and assign it at the same time, insted of the code above.
/*
Example: 
let message = "Hello";
*/

alert(message);


let name = 'Johnn';
let age = '25';
let message2 = 'World';

 
// Alternatively we can assign multiple variable leke an example below:
/*
let name = 'John',
    age = '25',
    message2 = 'World'; 
*/


// !!! In the older version of script you usually will see "var" key instead of "let" key of declaration of variable

/*
 var message3 = "Hello, world";

 However, as mentioned earlier, it is not commot to see using of it in modern code sample;
*/


// Variable is mutable, and can change it's value by reassigning it.


message='World';
// the previous value of variable "message" was "Hello", now it's a "World"

alert(message)
